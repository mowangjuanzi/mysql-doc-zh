# Chapter 8 Optimization

This chapter explains how to optimize MySQL performance and provides examples. Optimization involves configuring, tuning, and measuring performance, at several levels. Depending on your job role (developer, DBA, or a combination of both), you might optimize at the level of individual SQL statements, entire applications, a single database server, or multiple networked database servers. Sometimes you can be proactive and plan in advance for performance, while other times you might troubleshoot a configuration or code issue after a problem occurs. Optimizing CPU and memory usage can also improve scalability, allowing the database to handle more load without slowing down.
