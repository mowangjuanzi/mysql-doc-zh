The transactional features of InnoDB adhere to the ACID principles.">ACID</a> principles.</p>
<p>Transactions are <strong><em><a href="GLOSSARY.html#atomic" class="glossary-term" title="In the SQL context, transactions are units of work that either succeed entirely (when committed) or have no effect at all (when rolled back). The indivisible (&quot;atomic&quot;) property of transactions is the âAâ in the acronym ACID.">atomic</a></em></strong> units of work that can be <strong><em>committed</em></strong> or <strong><em>rolled back</em></strong>. When a transaction makes multiple changes to the database, either all the changes succeed when the transaction is committed, or all the changes are undone when the transaction is rolled back.</p>
<p>The database remains in a consistent state at all times â after each <a href="GLOSSARY.html#commit" class="glossary-term" title="A SQL statement that ends a transaction, making permanent any changes made by the transaction. It is the opposite of rollback, which undoes any changes made in the transaction.">commit</a> or rollback, and while transactions are in progress. If related data is being updated across multiple tables, queries see either all old values or all new values, not a mix of old and new values.</p>
<p>Transactions are protected (isolated) from each other while they are in progress; they cannot interfere with each other or see each other&apos;s uncommitted data. This isolation is achieved through the <strong><em>locking</em></strong> mechanism. Experienced users can adjust the <strong><em>isolation level</em></strong>, trading off less protection in favor of increased performance and <strong><em><a href="GLOSSARY.html#concurrency" class="glossary-term" title="The ability of multiple operations (in database terminology, transactions) to run simultaneously, without interfering with each other. Concurrency is also involved with performance, because ideally the protection for multiple simultaneous transactions works with a minimum of performance overhead, using efficient mechanisms for locking.">concurrency</a></em></strong>, when they can be sure that the transactions really do not interfere with each other.</p>
<p>The results of transactions are durable: once a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#commit" class="glossary-term" title="A SQL statement that ends a transaction, making permanent any changes made by the transaction. It is the opposite of rollback, which undoes any changes made in the transaction.">commit</a> operation succeeds, the changes made by that transaction are safe from power failures, system crashes, race conditions, or other potential dangers that many non-database applications are vulnerable to. Durability typically involves writing to disk storage, with a certain amount of redundancy to protect against power failures or software crashes during write operations.

<h2 id="business-rules">business rules</h2>
<p>The relationships and sequences of actions that form the basis of business software, used to run a commercial company. Sometimes these rules are dictated by law, other times by company policy. Careful planning ensures that the relationships encoded and enforced by the database, and the actions performed through application logic, accurately reflect the real policies of the company and can handle real-life situations.</p>
<p>For example, an employee leaving a company might trigger a sequence of actions from the human resources department. The human resources database might also need the flexibility to represent data about a person who has been hired, but not yet started work. Closing an account at an online service might result in data being removed from a database, or the data might be moved or flagged so that it could be recovered if the account is re-opened. A company might establish policies regarding salary maximums, minimums, and adjustments, in addition to basic sanity checks such <a href="GLOSSARY.html#as" class="glossary-term" title="A Kerberos authentication server.
